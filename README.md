# Link Prediction and Social Network Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a social network graph, computes metrics for nodes and edges, and implements link prediction algorithms. Metrics include custom values (`True`, `Indeterminacy`, `Falsity`) and traditional algorithms like Common Neighbors and Jaccard Index.

## Dataset
- **Vertex Data (`Vertex.csv`)**: Node attributes (e.g., friends, engagement).
- **Edge Data (`Edge.csv`)**: Relationships with mutual friend weights.
- **Predicted Edges (`Predict_edge.csv`)**: Potential edges with distance metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas networkx matplotlib tabulate
3. Add the following files to the project directory: Vertex.csv, Edge.csv, and Predict_edge.csv to the project directory.
## Workflow
1. Graph Construction: Build and visualize the social network.
2. Node Metrics: Calculate True Value, Indeterminacy, and Falsity.
3. Edge Metrics: Compute metrics like normalized True Value.
4. Location-Based Metrics: Analyze distances for prediction.
5. Link Prediction: Implement algorithms (e.g., Jaccard, Adamic-Adar).
6. Comparison: Normalize scores and visualize results.
## Algorithms
- Custom Metrics: True Value, Indeterminacy, Falsity.
- Traditional Methods: Common Neighbors, Jaccard Index, Adamic-Adar, etc.
##Results
- Visualized graph with node/edge metrics.
- Compared link prediction scores across methods.
